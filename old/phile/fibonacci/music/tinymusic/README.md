# TinyMusic2

direct fork of the original with some changes and extensions.

## Changes

* Refactored to be more ES6y
* Changed Note constructor to fit purposes and input format

## Extensions

Added functionality to play multi instrument and polyphone songs.

You can make songs with https://onlinesequencer.net/, export as local file and pass the filecontent to the Song constructor.



Below: Original documentation, is this one lacks lots of info. On the other hand its useless right now.

TODO fix this.



TinyMusic
=========

[![Built Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevincennis/TinyMusic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevincennis/TinyMusic)

A simple, lightweight music synth/sequencer in JavaScript using the Web Audio API.

Here's a quick, hideous [demo](http://jsbin.com/nilepiviva/1/edit?js,output).

You can also see (a slightly modified version of) TinyMusic in action in this [js13k entry](http://js13kgames.com/entries/crasis).

Available on npm via `npm install tinymusic`.

---

## Changelog

Version 1.0.0 removes some weirdness around module format.

If you put `dist/TinyMusic.js` directly into your page with no
RequireJS/browserify/etc, you'll get a global object called `TinyMusic` that
exposes `Note` and `Sequence`.

Otherwise, you should be able to `require('tinymusic')` with browserify,
or `require('./node_modules/tinymusic/dist/TinyMusic.js')` with RequireJS,
which will give you an object containing both `Note` and `Sequence`.

## Quick Start

Getting started is pretty easy. Creating and playing a melody only takes a few lines of code.

```js
// create a new Web Audio API context
var ac = new AudioContext();

// set the playback tempo (120 beats per minute)
var tempo = 120;

// create some notes ('<Note Name> <Beat Length>')
// q = quarter note, h = half note (more on that later)
var note1 = new TinyMusic.Note('G3 q');
var note2 = new TinyMusic.Note('E4 q');
var note3 = new TinyMusic.Note('C4 h');

// create a new sequence
var sequence = new TinyMusic.Sequence( ac, tempo );

// add the notes
sequence.push( note1, note2, note3 );

// disable looping
sequence.loop = false;

// play it
sequence.play();

```

To eliminate a bit of boilerplate, you can also pass an array of strings to the `Sequence` constructor. Here's the last example, tweaked to take advantage of that:

```js
// create a new Web Audio API context
var ac = new AudioContext();

// set the playback tempo (120 beats per minute)
var tempo = 120;

// create a new sequence
var sequence = new TinyMusic.Sequence( ac, tempo, [
  'G3 q',
  'E4 q',
  'C4 h'
]);

// disable looping
sequence.loop = false;

// play it
sequence.play();
```

## Documentation

### Note

The `Note` constructor only accepts one argument: a string that dictates note frequency and duration. An example input string might look like `'A4 q'`.

In that example, `'A4'` refers to the frequency 440Hz ([more on that here](http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html)), and `'q'` means "quarter note".

To create a rest, you can pass in any "note name" that's not valid. I usually use `'-'`. So `'- q'` would be a quarter note rest (or one beat of silence for you non-music-types).

The duration component of the string can follow a few different forms:

- `'w'` is a whole note
- `'h'` is a half note
- `'q'` is a quarter note
- `'e'` is an eighth note
- `'s'` is a sixteenth note
- `'es'` is a dotted eighth note (eighth plus sixteenth). This works for any combination of the letters above.
- `'0.0125'` is a 32nd note, but any numeric value will work here. So `'2'` would be a half note, `'0.5'` would be an eighth note, etc.

After the constructor is run, `Note` instances have two properties:

- `frequency` is a number representing the note's frequency in Hz
- `duration` is the ratio of beat length (always 1) to the note's time value. `1` would be a quarter note, `0.5` a half note, etc.

### Sequence

The `Sequence` constructor accepts 3 arguments, but all are optional:

`ac` is an `AudioContext` instance. If not provided, one will be created -- but you *really* should provide one.
`tempo` is a tempo in beats per minute. If not provided, a default tempo of 120 will be set.
`arr` is an array of `Note` instances or strings (like the ones passed to the `Note` constructor).

The `Sequence` class has a bunch of methods and properties, but only a few are really intended to be "public":

#### Sequence.loop

The `loop` property is a boolean value that controls whether or not the sequence will play repeatedly. By default, its value is set to `true`.

#### Sequence.smoothing

The `smoothing` property controls portamento (smoothly sliding from one frequency to the next). The `smoothing` value should be a number between `0` (no smoothing) to `1` (lots of smoothing). The default value is `0`.

#### Sequence.staccato

The `staccato` property controls "choppiness". With a value of `0`, notes will play out for their entire duration. With a value of `1`, they'll be harshly truncated. By default, the `staccato` value is `0`.

#### Sequence.gain

The `gain` property is a Web Audio [`GainNode`](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#GainNode).

There's too much to fully cover it here, but basically:

```js
var sequence = new TinyMusic.Sequence();

// the double "gain" isn't a typo. the GainNode instance has a property
// called "gain", which has a "value" that you can set
sequence.gain.gain.value = 0.5; // half volume
```

#### Sequence.bass

The `bass` property is a Web Audio [`BiquadFilterNode`](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-biquadfilternode-interface).

If that sounds scary, just know this: it's basically just an EQ slider that controls low-end frequencies (centered around 100Hz by default)

```js
var sequence = new TinyMusic.Sequence();

// give the sequence some sweet, sweet bass (positive values add bass, negative values reduce it)
sequence.bass.gain.value = 10;
```

#### Sequence.mid

Same as `Sequence.bass`, but focuses on midrange frequencies (1000Hz by default)

#### Sequence.treble

Same as `Sequence.bass`, but focuses on higher frequencies (2500Hz by default)

#### Sequence.waveType

The `waveType` property defines what kind of oscillator the sequence will use. By default, oscillators use `'square'` waves because they sound totally fucking awesome. You can also use `'sine'`, `'sawtooth'`, or `'triangle'`.

#### Sequence.createCustomWave(real, imaginary)

Creates a custom waveType to use with `Sequence.waveType = 'custom'`. This will create and set a [periodicWaveForm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode.setPeriodicWave) on the sequencer's OscillatorNode. `real` and `imaginary` should both be Arrays (they will be converted to Float32Array) and they must be the same length, or the AudioContext will generate an error. If no value is supplied for `imaginary`, `real` will be duplicated.

```js
var sequence = new TinyMusic.Sequence(ac, tempo, harmony);
sequence.play();

// An electric piano/organy (The Doors-ish) sound
sequence.createCustomWave([-0.8, 1, 0.8, 0.8, -0.8, -0.8, -1]);

// A soft, sine-like wave (a little grittier than plain "sine")
sequence.createCustomWave([-1,0,1,0,-1,0,1]);

// A bit grittier, sounds a little more like a horn
sequence.createCustomWave([-1,1,-1,1,-1,1],[1,0,1,0,1,0]);

// Trumpety
sequence.createCustomWave([-1,-0.9,-0.6,-0.3, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,1]);
```

#### Sequence.prototype.push()

The `push()` method accepts any number of `Note` instances (or "note strings" that can be passed to the `Note` constructor) and adds them to the sequence.

#### Sequence.prototype.play()

The `play()` method begins playback of your sequence. It optionally accepts a [Web Audio timestamp](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-AudioContext-currentTime) to determine when playback should begin.

If no timestamp is supplied (or the timestamp is in the past) playback will begin immediately.

#### Sequence.prototype.stop()

The `stop()` method stops all playback immediately.

### Full example

Here's a more elaborate demo that shows how to play multiple sequences in sync, as well as use gain and EQ:

```js
// create the audio context
var ac = new AudioContext(),
  // get the current Web Audio timestamp (this is when playback should begin)
  when = ac.currentTime,
  // set the tempo
  tempo = 132,
  // initialize some vars
  sequence1,
  sequence2,
  sequence3,
  // create an array of "note strings" that can be passed to a sequence

## Development

- Install Node.js
- Run `npm install`
- Run `grunt`

Voila!

I also have `grunt watch` set up to automatically build when you change a source file.

## Contributing

Go for it. I wrote this in an afternoon, it could *probably* be improved. Pull
requests are completely welcome, but please make sure that the test suite
passes and that you conform to the [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/) style guide.

## Issues

File 'em. I'm happy to fix bugs or answer questions.

I'm probably not gonna look to add many more features though, since this is really intended to be a very small library (people are using it for [js13k](http://js13kgames.com/), so, I mean...).
