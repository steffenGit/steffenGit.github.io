### Hi,

I'm Steffen,

software engineer from northern Germany working in the telecommunications industry.


Over the past years, I collected lots of little experiments, demos, simulations etc.
Some of them lost over the years, the rest mostly undocumented stuff on my hard drive.

I want to reprogram some of the lost ones and tidy up the others, but I never do.

This site should be the reason to finally do it.

I do this mostly for myself, but if you find something useful for yourself, feel free to comment.

That's it for now,

Steffen
